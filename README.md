## Why Queriously?

Queriously was born out of a desire to dive back into Spring Boot and level up my Next.js knowledge. This project is a fun experiment where I mix backend and frontend magic into one neat package. Itâ€™s a playground for trying out cool coding tricks, handling errors smartly, and building APIs that just work without all the fuss.
