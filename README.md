# BlogApp-Backend

**A Spring Boot backend for a feature-rich blog app!**

This repo is my way of diving back into Spring Boot after a couple of years. It’s designed to serve as a reference for backend best practices and includes clean, documented code. Whether you're building your own blog app or just looking for some Spring Boot inspiration, this repo might be a great starting point!

   - Fetch comments for specific blog posts.

3. **Category APIs**
